I just checked the daily report and I have to say, I'm impressed! The place is still standing, and our reputation is looking solid. Thank you.

I just saw the report for the re-opening. A solid performance for your first day, especially since you were on your own. Good work keeping things running.

I just looked over the report. Today was a bit of a rocky start, and it looks like a few customers left unhappy. Re-openings are always tough, and it was your first day alone, so don't get too discouraged.

When you're finished tidying up and are ready to call it a night, just head on out the front door; the system will lock up automatically behind you. Feel free to take as much time as you need to prep for tomorrow or rearrange things to your liking.

Speaking of which, don't feel like you have to do everything by hand. I've authorized you to use the day's earnings to invest back into the kitchen. If a task is getting tedious, buy a machine to help out! Working smart is just as important as working hard. In the back corner of the kitchen, there are all the tools you'll need to re-arrange things to your liking or to create a more efficient layout, too. A good flow can make all the difference when things get busy.

Now, for tomorrow: we're bringing back our simple combination dishes. This means you'll start getting orders for things that require multiple ingredients. It’s simple, really: to prepare a full dish, just place all of its required ingredients on a plate at the same time and combine them. It's all about good presentation!

Get some rest. You've earned it. Based on today, I know you'll handle tomorrow just fine.

[reputation=medium]
Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow will be a new challenge, but I think you're getting the hang of it.

Make sure you read the rest of this email carefully—the tools I'm giving you access to should help a lot. Let's aim for a much smoother day tomorrow. I know you can turn this around.

Best,
Your Boss"
